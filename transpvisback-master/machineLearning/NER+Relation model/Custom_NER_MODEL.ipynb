Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom \n","to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee \n","your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its \n","users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software \n","and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software \n","Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can \n","apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not \n","price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to \n","distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive \n","source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in \n","new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need \n","to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the \n","rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of \n","the software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, \n","whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must \n","make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these \n","terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the \n","software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute \n","and/or modify the software. Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make \n","certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software \n","is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have \n","is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original \n","authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We \n","wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent \n","licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that \n","any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. The precise terms and \n","conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR \n","COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License applies to any program or other \n","work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under \n","the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or \n","work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work \n","under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either \n","verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation \n","is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \n","Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they \n","are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the \n","Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of \n","having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program \n","does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you \n","receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each \n","copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that \n","refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the \n","Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical \n","act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for \n","a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a \n","work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the \n","terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) You must cause \n","the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of \n","any change. b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part \n","contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no \n","charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. c) If the modified program normally \n","reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such \n","interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an \n","appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty \n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#!pip install spacy-transformers\n","import spacy\n","import spacy_transformers\n","nlp = spacy.load('/content/drive/MyDrive/3CS/Custom_NER/trained_models/output/model-best')\n","# Process the extracted text using the loaded spaCy NER model\n","doc = nlp(text)\n","\n","# Iterate through the named entities (entities) recognized by the model\n","for ent in doc.ents:\n","  # Print the recognized text and its corresponding label\n","  print(ent.text, \"  ->>>>  \", ent.label_)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2Cl8lWsDCK9U","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711065739654,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":15950,"user":{"displayName":"sara laouadi","userId":"00288894113635826787"}},"outputId":"f8c9c14a-aed4-4743-d842-52782b20dcd9"},"id":"2Cl8lWsDCK9U","execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Free Software \n","Foundation, Inc.   ->>>>   ENTITY\n","users.   ->>>>   ENTITY\n","Free Software Foundation's   ->>>>   ENTITY\n","Free Software \n","Foundation software   ->>>>   ENTITY\n","third parties   ->>>>   ENTITY\n"]}]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.12"},"colab":{"provenance":[],"gpuType":"T4"},"accelerator":"GPU"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
